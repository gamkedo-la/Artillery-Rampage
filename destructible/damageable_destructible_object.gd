## [b][i]Non-tank damageable object should define these signals as well as the take_damage function.[/i][/b]
## Something to note is that the WeaponProjectile class actually emits
## GameEvents.took_damage so this looks like a doubling, but I am following
## convention of the project in case existing systems (spawners) depend on this.
signal took_damage(object: Node, instigatorController: Node2D, instigator: Node2D, amount: float)
## Simpler signal for use by other local nodes (i.e. a personal healthbar).
