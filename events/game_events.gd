## Emitted when a destructible or damageable object takes damage.
## Only Damageable objects will have a damage > 0 as it is only relevant for health-aware nodes.
## Note that fall damage is currently only available through the tank.tank_took_damage signal and is not emitted here.
## [param object] The root node in a scene that has a Damageable group membership node
## [param instigatorController] The controller Node2D that caused the damage. Currently this is always a TankController or null
## [param instigator] The Node2D that caused the damage. Example would be a WeaponProjectile or the object if it was fall damage
## [param contact_point] The point of contact where the damage occurred.
## [param damage] The amount of raw damage that was done to the object. This is always > 0 for Damageable objects and 0 for destructible objects. This is not clamped to damageable object health.
