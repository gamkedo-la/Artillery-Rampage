class_name Explosion extends Node2D

## Starts SFX and Particles and frees itself once all are finished.
## This class only handles CPUParticles2D and AudioStreamPlayer2D at this time.
## It will wait until all nodes assigned in the Inspector export properties have
## emitted their finished signal. Assigning a node that loops will prevent this
## node from queue_free().
## It might make sense for this to also have the functionality for damage, if we
## move it from the WeaponProjectile class.

@export var particles:Array[CPUParticles2D] ## Will wait until all emit finished to queue_free
# AudioStreamPlayer and AudioStreamPlayer2D are not related
# Also we could use the type of Player that layers sounds itself.
@export var sfx:Array[AudioStreamPlayer2D] ## Will wait until all emit finished to queue_free
@export var lights:Array[PointLight2D] ## Will fade out the light's energy property to 0.
