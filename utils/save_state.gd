## Stores global game state that can extend beyond a given level
## To use tag a class with group "Savable"
## When instantiating that class in group 
## 1) define a function 
##      func restore_from_save_state(save: SaveState) -> void
##    to restore node from save state and it will be called when loading save state
## You need to handle if this is called before or after _ready. Currently it will be called after _ready based on SceneManager implementation
## 2) Define a function with signature 
##      func update_save_state(save:SaveState) -> void
##   and it will be called when the save system is invoked
##   and allow class to read into dictionary for its saved state and downcast to resource derived type it stored
## It will set/update any keys in this dictionary with its resource derived state
## 3) For convenience it is also recommended to add a constant 
##       const SAVE_STATE_KEY:StringName 
##        to the class that stores all its state under the given key
class_name SaveState
