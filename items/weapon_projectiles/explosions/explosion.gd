class_name Explosion extends Node2D
## Starts SFX and Particles and frees itself once all are finished.
##
## This class only handles [CPUParticles2D] and [AudioStreamPlayer2D] at this time.
## It will wait until all nodes assigned in the Inspector export properties have
## emitted their finished signal. [b]Assigning a node that loops will prevent this
## node from queue_free().[/b]
## [br]
## Note that the [Wind] automatically applies itself using [member CPUParticles2D.gravity]
## in [i]_physics_process[/i] to all members of the [b]Wind_CPUParticles2D[/b] Global Group.
## [br]
## It might make sense for this to also have the functionality for damage, even
## if the math for it remains in the WeaponProjectile class...
